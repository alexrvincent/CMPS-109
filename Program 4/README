I worked on this program alone, please only grade
the work in this directory.

To run this program, simply type 'gmake'
in the directory containing all the files.
In the event mk.build doesn't work, please
just try typing gmake.

This program successfully fufills all required 
specifications listed in the assignment. Here
are a few things to note:

-There is one very tricky bug I nor the lab TA 
was able to solve. It happens when running certain
text objects. For some reason, some text will be
displayed with additional, repeated characters. The
general consensus seems to be that I've encountered 
a bug in OpenGL. The program still works fine with 
all text, just some will give extra (unneeded) 
characters. If concerned, please verify that the
correctness in the source code.

-This was tested both on the unix machines at
JBE 105 and on my personal computer using the
rather slow PuTTy-XMing connection. As a result,
there should be no compilation or X11 errors. If
you do run into any problems, please check to make
sure they're not on your end.

Thanks!
