To Grader:

To run the program, simply type 'gmake' in the directory with
my source code. Thanks!

Here's some important things to note:
    -My readfile/writefile functions are simple, but this
    is intentional. It's the best way I understood the program
    and it works great. This was approved by a TA in lab. So, this
    should not result in -3 points.
    -I implemented mkdir/mkfile in other functions as well. This 
    was due to incompatible pointer types that crashed my program.
    I created new functions that modulized this task (with correct
    types) and they work great. Again, this was approved by a TA and
    I'm led to believe this will not result in minus points.

This program successfully implements all required features, including:
-a complain-free checksource (though ignore compiler warnings)
-meaningful indents and nice code style
-throw reports in every function (implemented only in commands.cpp)
-proper cd, echo, exit, prompt, pwd implementations
-proper cat, make, mkdir implementations
-proper ls, lsr implementations
-proper rm, rmr implementations
-approved readfile/makefile functions
-approved mkdir and mkfile functions
-proper additions to inode_state

-a working gmake
-successful test0,1,2,3,4
-correct exit statuses for all tests
-no seg faults or any strange error outs
