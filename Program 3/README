I WORKED ALONE ON THIS PROGRAM. GRADE THE CONTENTS OF THIS DIRECTORY

To run the program, simply type 'gmake' in the directory with
my source code. Thanks!

This program was constructed with the started code provided
by professor Mackey. Some basic algorithms (split, trim) were
referenced from various stackoverflow websites.
    
This program successfully implements all required features.
