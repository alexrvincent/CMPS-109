This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Alex Vincent (avincent@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Nader Sleem (nsleem@ucsc.edu)

The submitted program fulfils all the requirements listed in
the SCORE file. The only deviation we took was on implementing
some helper functions. It has been made very obvious in the
code via comments where our deviations lie. So if you're looking
for code in a function (such as divide_by_2) and you're not
finding it, it's guaranteed going to tell you where it is. Everything
else is completely in accordance with the assignment.

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at more 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work together,
learning from each other, not to divide the work into 
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece

Alex Vincent spent 10 hours working alone
Nader Sleem spent 10 hours working alone
We spent 20 hours working together
Alex Vincent spent 10 hours driving
Nader Sleem spent 10 hours driving.
