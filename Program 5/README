I have worked alone on this assignment. I have used
the starter code provided from Prof. Mackey and only
worked in the cix-client and cix-server modules. All
implemented functions were done with the assistance of
misc code directories and some online help from 
stackoverflow. Simply run 'gmake' in this directory
to compile the program 

To the grader: I've had some strange issues running the
program on localhost. Make sure you are logged into the same
timeshare as is the daemon is running on, then localhost works.
If for some reason running localhost doesn't work, please run
the program with the timeshare's name that the daemon is running
on. This is guaranteed to work. Thanks!
